TODOs:
- Write code to test if your moving averages are computed correctly


- Learning

- Udacity Course: ML for Trading Georgia Tech
- Books:
- Python for finance
- What hedge funds really do

- Content:
- Bollinger Bands, moving average and moving stds
- Fill missing data using df.fillna() forward fill and backfill instead of interpolation
- Histogram plots of daily returns
- Histogram plots of two stocks together
- Scatter plot of two stocks together
- Sharpe Ratio: mean/std of (daily return - risk free return)
- Risk free return estimate: LIBOR, 3month treasury bill, 0%
- Sharpe Ratio is an annual measure, must be adjusted for frequency per year
- Optimizer, optimizing for Sharpe ratio
- ETFs Exchange Traded Funds, Mutual Funds
- Expense Ratio: portfolio managers receive some fraction of AUM (Assets under management)
- 2 and twenty commonly hedge fund managers receive 2% expense ratio and 20% of profits
- Geographic Arbitrage: Hedge funds take advantages of retail traders trading further away geographically, differences in price at different exchanges
- Interests rates, what is a dollar worth? present value = future value/(1 + interest rate)^years until money received
- iNTRINSIC: replace interest rate with discount rate. Higher means it is less likely to pay. Sum into infinite future : Future Value/ Discount Rate
- Book value: Total assets - liabilities (loans) - intangible assets (brand, patents)
- Market Cap: no. of shares * share price
- Market Portfolio, US: S&P 500, UK: FTSE, etc. Within these "oceans" there are islands: energy, finance, etc.

CAPM (Capital Assets Pricing Model) equation is as follows (describing the return of a single stock)
- r_i(t) = b_i*r_m(t) + a_i
- r_m(t) is the returns of the market
- a_i is the residual, which expectation = 0
- CAPM implications: probably just buy and hold index funds that follow market, choose high beta in up markets and low beta in down markets
- arbitrage pricing theory says break up beta into different "islands" i.e., r_i(t) = b_F*r_F(t) + b_E*r_E(t) + ... + a_i F for finance and E for energy
- technical analysis better for the short term
Features:
- momentum indicator, calculates the returns of the current price to price n days ago
- Simple Moving Average (SMA) calculates the return of current price to n day moving average price
- Bollinger Bands current price - SMA/2*stds
- How adjustment works ("Adj Close")
- Survivor Bias data. Some stocks "died" during the 2008 crash, so predicting the SPY using current stocks biases the model
Efficient Markets Hypothesis (EMH)
- Large number of investors in market for profit
- New information arrives randomly
- Prices are adjusted quickly
- Prices reflect all available information
Information Sources
- Price/Volume data
- Fundamental
- Exogenous
- Company insiders
EMH
- Weak: can't predict future prices using current prices (no TA)
- Medium: Prices adjust rapidly to new public info (no FA)
- Strong: Prices reflect all information public and private (no Insider info)
Risk:
- Probability that you lose it all
- Standard deviation of bets
- Standard deviation of daily returns
- 
Fundamental law of active portfolio management
- Information Ratio: using CAPM model, IR = mean(alpha)/std(alpha) of alpha component of CAPM (sharpe ratio of excess returns over market)
- Information Coefficient: Correlation of forecasts to returns
- Breadth: number of trading opportunities per year
- IR = IC*sqrt(breadth)
Mean Variance Optimization
Efficient Frontier - optimal line, minimal risk for each return.
Inputs:
- Expected return
- Volatility
- Covariance
- target return
Ouputs:
- Asset weightings that minimize risk
